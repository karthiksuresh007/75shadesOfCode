# 🧠 Neet150 DSA Log

Welcome to my personal log for cracking the [NeetCode 150](https://neetcode.io/practice) challenge — one problem at a time, one optimized solution at a time.

This repo is my way of mastering **Data Structures & Algorithms** for FAANG-level interviews and beyond.

---

## 🚀 Objective

- Solve all **150 curated problems** from NeetCode.
- Cover all essential **DSA patterns**: sliding window, two pointers, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, and more.
- Maintain clean, readable, and optimized code.
- Document approach, edge cases, and time/space complexity for each problem.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Language: `C++ / Python / Java` (Update this to your preferred one)
- IDE: `VS Code`
- Tools: `LeetCode`, `NeetCode`, `Git`, `GitHub`
